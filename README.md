# Let's try out AWS Batch

## Purpose

Develop an example of how AWS batch might be used at the Hutch to provide
computing resources to researchers or applications

## Goals

 - Demonstration of a "usual" bioinformatic workflow implemented using AWS
   batch, for example, X!Tandem searches, RNAseq expression analysis, etc.
 - documentation on that setup
 - indications where Batch would be useful and/or vaulable
 - automation components and templates (e.g. cloudformation, computing
   environment templates, et alia)
